[More information here](https://hyperboliclearning.github.io/events/kdd2025tutorial)  I'm leading a tutorial for hyperbolic foundation models at SIGKDD 2025! This tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of hyperbolic deep learning methods espeically their application to foundation models. It will cover the theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and future research directions in this exciting field. The tutorial is designed for a broad audience, including both newcomers and experts in machine learning, and will feature interactive components to engage participants.
