[More information here](https://hyperboliclearning.github.io/events/neurips2025negelworkshop)  I'm orgranizing a workshop for non-Euclidean Foundation Models at NeurIPS 2025! This workshop will include submissions, talks, and poster sessions on topics related to the intersection of foundation models and non-Euclidean representation learning, including theoretical foundations, architectures and algorithms, applications, trustworthiness and robustness, and benchmarks and tools.
